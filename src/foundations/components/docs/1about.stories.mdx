# ChatUI Components

ChatUI Components is a subset of Team Chat application source code placed in `src/foundations` folder,
which is responsible for delivering _foundational UI components_.
The components were extracted out from the `features` catalog of previous application version in order to:

- make the application easier to navigate and understand
- make the CSS more modular by separating parts of UI that is reused in many places
- make every aspect of the app visuals easy to modify and extend
- make it possible to replace various parts of UI with other component libraries with the use of _adapter pattern_
- be able to share the Chat components between different applications
